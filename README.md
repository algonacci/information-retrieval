# Information Retrieval

> Information Retrieval is the process through which a computer system can respond to a user's query for text-based information on a specific topic. IR was one of the first and remains one ofr the most important problems in the domain of natural laguague processing (NLP) - [stanford cs276](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs276/)

This repo contains tutorials covering the breadth of techniques available for IR.

Along with IR techniques, we will also cover:
- Techniques/metrics for evaluating IR models
- Approximate Nearest Neighbor techniques used for indexing and searching dense vectors (used for many dense retrieval techniques)
- Other relevant info ...


## Tutorials

* 1 - Classic Information Retrieval aka "The Inverted Index"

    IR in it's most basic form answers the question "how relevant is a given *query* for a *document*". The challenge is that we don't have just 1 document but potentially millions or billions of documents. So the key challenge is - how can we efficiently find this "needle in the haystack" or the "relevant *documents* for a *query*".

* 2 - Evaluation metrics
* 3 - Dense representation of works and sentences
* 4 - Dense IR
